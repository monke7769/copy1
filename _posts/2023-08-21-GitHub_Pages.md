### Github Pages now running

After installing the required software (Jekyll, Ruby, Makefile) and cloning the teacher repository, my personal Github pages is now running on the local server at 127.0.0.1:4000/student/. make is still not working for me currently, but the current workaround is running the following in terminal:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Made some edits including changes to the homepage text and wrote an About Me. Then made some commits to the monke7769/copy1 repo on github.
Will continue blogging on home page and using such posts as this.
