    "Obviously, Program 1 does the correct thing where the loop is executed 4 times. Each time, the robot moves forward, turns left, moves forward, and turns right. This is tantamount to the robot moving one block north and one block west, and resetting the robot's direction back to north. This then occurs 4 times, so the robot in total moves north 4 blocks and west 4 blocks. So both programs achieve the desired outcome.\n",

    "In USACO, O(n^2) time complexity is almost never the correct solution and most of the time does not run within the time constraints. Testcases with n > 10^4 would not pass on a python O(n^2) algorithm. But we must conform to Collegeboard standards."
