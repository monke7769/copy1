    "I will be working with my pair Andrew Kim this trimester (we only have 2 people). Since we are the only non-triangle group in the class, we will have to adapt and establish our roles accordingly. I will focused on the backend with the dataset and models/functions, while Andrew focuses on importing a good theme for the frontend and making user input. We will figure out together what our ML project should be on and search for a database together. If we need help, Ian \"Sensei\" Wu can be our 2.5th member and we can also get assistance from crossover group (Ian, Harkirat, Shubhay)."
