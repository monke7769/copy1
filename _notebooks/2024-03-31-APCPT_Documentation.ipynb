    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team's project is a button designer/sharing website where users can use the button creator interface to make buttons. Users must first signup (add a new account to the database), then they can access all features of the website. The button designs can be customized with width, height, color, and even button animations. The designs can then be saved as 2 types: public (everyone can access) or private (only the user who made them can access).\n",
    "\n",
    "The search page on the website catalogues all the designs and users may enter keywords and select whether they wish to view all users' public designs or their own private designs. Once the designs have been fetched, they will be displayed in a table with rows containing all the relevant data for that design.\n",
    "\n",
    "My portion of the project was the search function. I worked on the HTML and JS for the frontend portion, as well as helping with the CRUD code on the backend. The CRUD code makes use of Object-Oriented Programming, and the backend is deployed on a Flask server using port 8086.\n",

    "As hinted at in the introduction, the design database contains relevant information in storing all the designs (both public and private). The details include:\n",
    "- design name\n",
    "- type (public/private)\n",
    "- specific button content (the button design HTML)\n",
    "- the user who made the design\n",
    "- the numbers of likes and dislikes\n",
