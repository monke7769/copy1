    "My team worked extensively over the past half-trimester on our CPT project. Our main focus was a button creator website (like mini Wix with limited functionality). Our project idea stemmed from the experience we had when doing the binary CPT warmup (the button-HTML heavy UI page). With this website, we aim to improve the efficiency (and lives) of software devs creating webpages by assisting them in button creation syntax.\n",
