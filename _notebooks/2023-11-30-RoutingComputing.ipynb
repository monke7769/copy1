    "Question 1: What is parallel computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel computing uses multiple cores to execute a single program simultaneously, by breaking down the code into smaller parts for each core to execute at the same time. This increases execution speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: If there is a computer with 3 cores that can each take one task, and the tasks are 25ms, 632ms and 100ms in run time respectively, how long will the program take to run?\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will run in 632 ms since that is the longest task and one core will have to spend that amount of time to execute its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Is sequential or parallel computing more efficient, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel computing is more efficient, especially for programs/tasks that are larger-scale and more complex. This is because by splitting up the program into separate parts to be executed at the same time, the computing will be finished faster than if the program is executed through sequential computing (one task after another).\n",
