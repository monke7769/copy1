## Mon 8/21

Finished setting up student repo. Started with a bit of blogging. 
### Plans

Figure out how the make command works? I'm currently using 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve 
```
to host the site locally - which is putting the site at [127.0.0.1:4000/student/](127.0.0.1:4000/student/). Hopefully I figure this out soon
```
make: *** [_posts/2023-08-17-AP-pseudo-vs-python_IPYNB_2_.md] Error 1
```

### Tools

The biggest tool involved in the making of this website is Makefile. Makefile defines a set of tasks to be executed, such as in the case of having a website, it will define tasks such as starting the local server, starting logging, and converting notebook files to Markdown to be read.

## Tues 8/22

Figured out make (finally) the command that fixed everything was 
```
ln -s /opt/homebrew/share/jupyter/nbconvert ~/Library/Jupyter
```
hopefully no more problems with setting up the site. working on putting images and new theme on the about me page.

## Thurs 8/24

I want to use this theme:
[https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk)

It looks so good but I haven't figured out how to import the theme into my github pages
I have changed the _config.yml file to use 
```
remote_theme: abhinavs/moonwalk
```
and even tried copy-pasting the contents of moonwalk.gemspec into this repo's Gemfile but neither has worked.. 
right now running the server gives me a file not found error

I'm going to try to investigate the cause of the error in _includes/head.html and in _layouts. wish me luck

## Fri 8/25

Learned/reviewed some of the basics in Python. From now on, blogging with code will be in the "Blog" section of the site (using *.ipynb files) and located in the table in the CompSci Notebook page.
