## Mon 8/21

Finished setting up student repo. Started with a bit of blogging. 
### Plans

Figure out how the make command works? I'm currently using 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve 
```
to host the site locally - which is putting the site at [127.0.0.1:4000/student/](127.0.0.1:4000/student/). Hopefully I figure this out soon
```
